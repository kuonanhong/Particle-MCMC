There are two main purposes for this code. One is to provide base classes for different filters (e.\+g. the Kalman Filter, Sequential Importance Sampling with Resampling (S\+I\+SR), the Auxiliary Particle Filter (A\+PF), etc.). The other is to provide base classes for particle Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. This second category of base classes make use of the first category. Please see the different examples for demonstrations, which are located in my other repository {\ttfamily ssm\+\_\+examples}.

\subsection*{Installation}

If you want to build yourself, make sure to compile with C++11 enabled ({\ttfamily -\/std=c++11}), and obviously to include the {\ttfamily include} directory. Note, also, that this code all makes use of the \href{http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/}{\tt Eigen library}.

\subsection*{Organization of {\ttfamily src}}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily distributions} is all the code related to evaluating densities, mass functions, or pseudo-\/random number generation.
\item {\ttfamily mcmc\+\_\+bases} are all of the base classes for certain types of M\+C\+MC algorithms. Inheriting from these allows the user to skip writing a bunch of code.
\item {\ttfamily filter\+\_\+bases} are Kalman filtering and particle filtering base classes. Inheriting from these abstracts away all of the details of how this is performed. Particle filter base classes are pure virtual, while the closed form filtering classes (fshmm and lgssm) are not.
\item {\ttfamily utilities} functions that might be useful and have no other home (e.\+g. reading or logging data, transforming parameters with common functions, etc.).

\subsection*{To-\/\+Do List}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make a parameter class that organizes which are transformed, constrained, etc.
\item Implement more resampling options (different algorithms, different schedules, etc.)
\item make the resampler a template parameter
\item write more tests 
\end{DoxyItemize}
