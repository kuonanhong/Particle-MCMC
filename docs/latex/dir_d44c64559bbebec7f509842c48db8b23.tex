\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
file \hyperlink{apf__filter_8h}{apf\+\_\+filter.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A base class for Auxiliary Particle Filtering. Inherit from this if you want to use an A\+PF for your state space model. Filtering only, no smoothing. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{apf__smooth_8h}{apf\+\_\+smooth.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A base class for Auxiliary Particle Filtering. Inherit from this if you want to use an A\+PF for your state space model. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{bootstrap__filter_8h}{bootstrap\+\_\+filter.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em bootstrap particle filter \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{densities_8h}{densities.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Samples from univariate Normal distribution. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{hmm__rbpf__bs_8h}{hmm\+\_\+rbpf\+\_\+bs.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Rao-\/\+Blackwellized particle filtering where the innder models are discrete state hmms. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{hmm__rbpf__sisr_8h}{hmm\+\_\+rbpf\+\_\+sisr.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Rao-\/\+Blackwellized particle filtering where the innder models are discrete state hmms. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{kalman__rbpf__bs_8h}{kalman\+\_\+rbpf\+\_\+bs.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Rao-\/\+Blackwellized Particle Filter with Linear Gaussian submodel. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{kalman__rbpf__sisr_8h}{kalman\+\_\+rbpf\+\_\+sisr.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Rao-\/\+Blackwellized Particle Filter with Linear Gaussian submodel. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{mn__resampler_8h}{mn\+\_\+resampler.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A class used for all the multinomial resampling in any model. Keep in mind this is usually implemented by the base classes themselves, and so this would mean they are not touched by the typical end-\/user. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{multinomial__resampler_8h}{multinomial\+\_\+resampler.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A class used for all the multinomial resampling in any model. Keep in mind this is usually implemented by the base classes themselves, and so this would mean they are not touched by the typical end-\/user. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{pmfs_8h}{pmfs.\+h}
\item 
file \hyperlink{pmmh_8h}{pmmh.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A base class for particle marginal Metropolis-\/\+Hastings. Inherit from this if you want to use pmmh to estimate your S\+SM. The benefits are that doing so will force you to implement certain functions, and it will abstract away the threaded MH implementation. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{sisr__filter_8h}{sisr\+\_\+filter.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A base-\/class for Sequential Importance Sampling with Resampling. Inherit from this if you want to use a S\+I\+SR for your state space model. Filtering only; no smoothing. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{sisr__smooth_8h}{sisr\+\_\+smooth.\+h}
