\item\contentsline{section}{include/\hyperlink{mn__resampler_8h}{mn\+\_\+resampler.\+h} \\*A class used for all the multinomial resampling in any model. Keep in mind this is usually implemented by the base classes themselves, and so this would mean they are not touched by the typical end-\/user }{\pageref{mn__resampler_8h}}{}

\item\contentsline{section}{include/\hyperlink{pmmh_8h}{pmmh.\+h} \\*A base class for particle marginal Metropolis-\/\+Hastings. Inherit from this if you want to use pmmh to estimate your S\+SM. The benefits are that doing so will force you to implement certain functions, and it will abstract away the threaded MH implementation }{\pageref{pmmh_8h}}{}
